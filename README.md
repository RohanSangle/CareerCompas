# CareerCompas 

Students transitioning after 10th and 12th standards often lack access to personalized, comprehensive career guidance, leading to decisions driven by societal pressures or limited awareness of diverse career paths. This gap leaves students ill-equipped to align their aspirations, skills, and resources with viable career trajectories, resulting in suboptimal choices that hinder personal fulfillment and economic potential in a rapidly evolving job market. 
This project helps in solving this issue by incorporating the use of Agents and LLMs to deliver personalized career recommendations, comprehensive roadmaps, and actionable insights into diverse professional fields.
